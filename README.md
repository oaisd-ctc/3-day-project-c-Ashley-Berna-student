This project is a random word guessing game. Where the user will be trying to guess a randomly selected word.
The user will hava 6 lives in total. A live is lost each time the player doesn't guess a letter that is in the word.
When the user does guess a letter that is in the word, the word will be reprinted with the previous guessed letters being shown and the unguessed letters being shown as asterisks.
There are a few words that do have spaces, since it's actually more than one word. But the user won't ever have to guess that there are spaces.
