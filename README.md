This project is a random word guessing game. Where the user will be trying to guess a randomly selected word.
The user will hava 6 lives in total. A live is lost each time the player doesn't guess a letter that is in the word.
When the user does guess a letter that is in the word, the word will be reprinted with the previous guessed letters being shown and the unguessed letters being shown as asterisks.
There are a few words that do have spaces, since it's actually more than one word. But the user won't ever have to guess that there are spaces.
The spaces will be shown from the start of the game.
